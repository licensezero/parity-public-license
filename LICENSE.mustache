You are permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document.

You are permitted to use the Parity Public License terms
(possibly modified) in another license provided that you
call your license by another name.

This license lets you use and share this software for free, as
long as you contribute software you make with it. Specifically:

If you follow the rules below, you may do everything with this
software that would otherwise infringe either my copyright in it,
any patent claim I can license that covers this software as of my
latest contribution, or both.

1. Contribute source code for changes you make to this software.

2. If you run or combine this software with other software in any
   larger program, contribute all source code for that program.

3. Contribute all source code for software you develop, deploy,
   monitor, or run with this software.

4. Ensure everyone who gets a copy of this software from you,
   in source code or any other form, gets the text of this
   license and the copyright and source notices above.

5. Do not make any legal claim against anyone for infringing
   any patent claim they would infringe by using this software
   alone, accusing this software, with or without changes,
   alone or as part of a larger program.

To contribute source code, publish the preferred form for making
changes through a freely accessible distribution system widely
used for similar source code, and license contributions not
already licensed to the public on terms as permissive as this
license accordingly.

You are excused for unknowingly breaking 1, 2, or 3 if you
contribute source code, or stop doing anything requiring this
license, within 30 days of learning you broke the rule.

**This software comes as is, without any warranty at all. As far
as the law allows, I will not be liable for any damages related
to this software or this license, for any kind of legal claim.**
