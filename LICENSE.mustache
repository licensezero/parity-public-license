**This software comes as is, without any warranty at all.
As far as the law allows, we will not be liable for any
damages related to this software or this license, for any
kind of legal claim.**

You may do everything with this software that would infringe
our copyrights in it, or any patent claim any one of us can
license that you would infringe by using this software as of
their last code contribution, on these conditions:

1. You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of this
   software from you, in source code or any other form, also
   gets the complete text of this license and the copyright
   and source notices above.

2. You must not make any legal claim against anyone for
   infringing any patent claim they would infringe by using
   this software alone, accusing this software, with or
   without changes, alone or combined in a larger program.

3. If you change this software, you must release source code
   for your changes.

4. If you combine this software with other software to make
   a larger program, you must release any source code for
   that larger program that has not yet been released.

5. If you run this software to analyze, change, or generate
   software, you must release source code for that software
   that has not yet been released.

Releasing source code means publicly licensing it under
either this license or a license approved by the Open Source
Initiative, and promptly publishing it, in the preferred
form for making changes, to a freely accessible distribution
system widely used for similarly licensed source code.

Any unknowing failure to meet condition 3, 4, or 5 is
excused if you release source code as required, or stop
doing anything requiring permission under this license, in
30 days of learning that you were required to release.
